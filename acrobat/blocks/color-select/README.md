# Color Select Block

A simple block that displays a dropdown menu with 5 color options (Red, Blue, Green, Black, and White) and a 500x500 div that changes color based on the selection.

## Usage

Add the Color Select block to your page with:

```html
<div class="color-select"></div>
```

The block will automatically:

1. Create a dropdown menu with the 5 color options
2. Display a 500x500 div that changes color based on the selected option
3. Default to Red on initial load

## Customization

The block is styled with standard CSS that can be overridden by your own stylesheets if necessary.
